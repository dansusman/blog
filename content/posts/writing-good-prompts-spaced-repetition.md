# How to Write Good Prompts: Using Spaced Repetition to Create Understanding

Spaced repetition has revolutionized how we approach learning and memory retention, but the effectiveness of any spaced repetition system depends entirely on the quality of the prompts you create. Well-designed prompts don't just help you memorize facts—they build deep, lasting understanding that transfers to real-world situations.

The art of writing effective prompts requires understanding both the cognitive science of memory formation and the practical techniques that make information stick. This guide will walk you through the essential principles and provide concrete strategies for creating prompts that transform scattered knowledge into coherent understanding.

## The Three Pillars of Effective Retrieval Practice

### Consistency: The Foundation of Reliable Memory

Retrieval practice prompts should produce [consistent answers]{When you practice the same prompt multiple times, you should arrive at the same answer each time. This consistency strengthens the specific neural pathways and prevents confusion during future recall attempts.}, lighting the same bulbs each time you perform the task. Otherwise, you may run afoul of an interference phenomenon called "retrieval-induced forgetting": what you remember during practice is reinforced, but other related knowledge which you *didn't* recall is actually inhibited.

This effect has been reproduced in many experiments but is not yet well understood. For an overview, see Murayama et al, [Forgetting as a consequence of retrieval: a meta-analytic review of retrieval-induced forgetting]{This comprehensive meta-analysis examined studies where practicing some items led to forgetting of related, unpracticed items—a phenomenon that highlights why prompt consistency matters for effective learning.} (2014).

### Tractability: Making Knowledge Accessible

Retrieval practice prompts should be **tractable**. To avoid interference-driven churn and recurring annoyance in your review sessions, you should strive to write prompts which you can almost always answer correctly. This often means [breaking the task down, or adding cues]{Complex topics need to be decomposed into smaller, manageable pieces that can be learned incrementally. This process of atomization is crucial for effective spaced repetition systems.}.

SuperMemo's algorithms (also used by most other major systems) are tuned for 90% accuracy. Each review would likely have a larger impact on your memory if you targeted much lower accuracy numbers—see e.g. [Carpenter et al, Using Spacing to Enhance Diverse Forms of Learning]{Research shows that making retrieval more challenging can improve long-term retention, but spaced repetition systems optimize for a balance between difficulty and consistency to maintain sustainable practice habits.} (2012). Higher accuracy targets trade efficiency for reliability.

### Effort: The Engine of Memory Formation

Retrieval practice prompts should be **effortful**. It's important that the prompt actually involves retrieving the answer from memory. You shouldn't be able to trivially infer the answer. Cues are helpful, as we'll discuss later—just don't [give the answer away]{Providing too many cues or making the answer obvious defeats the purpose of retrieval practice. The cognitive effort required to recall information is what strengthens memory traces and builds lasting understanding.}. In fact, effort appears to be an important factor in the effects of retrieval practice. That's one motivation for spacing reviews out over time: if it's too easy to recall the answer, retrieval practice has little effect.

For more on the notion that difficult retrievals have a greater impact than easier retrievals, see the discussion in Bjork and Bjork, [A New Theory of Disuse and an Old Theory of Stimulus Fluctuation]{This foundational paper introduced the concept of "desirable difficulties" in learning, explaining why some challenges actually improve long-term retention by forcing deeper cognitive processing.} (1992). Pyc and Rawson, [Testing the retrieval effort hypothesis: Does greater difficulty correctly recalling information lead to higher levels of memory?]{This study provided experimental evidence that more difficult retrieval practice leads to better long-term memory formation than easier retrieval, supporting the idea that effort enhances learning.} (2009) offers some focused experimental tests of this theory, which they coin the "retrieval effort hypothesis."

## Achieving These Properties Through Strategic Design

Achieving these properties is mostly about writing tightly-scoped questions. When a prompt's scope is too broad, you'll usually have problems: retrieval will often lack a focused target; you may produce imprecise or inconsistent answers; you may find the prompt intractable. But writing tightly-scoped questions is surprisingly difficult. You'll need to break knowledge down into its discrete components so that you can build those pieces back up as prompts for retrieval practice.

### The Art of Knowledge Decomposition

[This decomposition also makes review more efficient]{Breaking complex knowledge into discrete, learnable components is perhaps the most important skill in creating effective spaced repetition systems. It allows for targeted practice of weak areas while maintaining overall understanding.}. The schedule will rapidly remove easy material from regular practice while ensuring you frequently review the components you find most difficult.

Consider this example of decomposing the concept of **photosynthesis**:

**Poor prompt** (too broad):
"Explain photosynthesis."

**Better prompts** (decomposed):
- "What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?"
- "Where in the plant cell do light reactions occur?"
- "What molecule captures light energy in photosynthesis?"
- "What is the chemical equation for the overall photosynthesis reaction?"

### Creating Effective Cues

[Cues serve as memory anchors]{Well-designed cues provide just enough context to trigger recall without giving away the answer. They should activate the right memory pathways while preserving the effortful nature of retrieval practice.} that help you access the right information without making the retrieval trivial. The key is providing just enough context to point you in the right direction while preserving the challenge of recall.

**Effective cueing strategies include:**

- **Contextual cues**: Provide the setting or domain
- **Structural cues**: Hint at the type of answer expected
- **Progressive cues**: Start general, become more specific if needed
- **Mnemonic cues**: Use memory devices you've created

### The Progressive Disclosure Technique

For complex topics that resist simple decomposition, consider using [progressive disclosure]{This technique allows you to build understanding gradually, starting with basic concepts and progressively adding complexity as your foundation solidifies over multiple review sessions.}. Create a series of prompts that build upon each other, starting with foundational concepts and gradually introducing more sophisticated elements.

**Example progression for understanding neural networks:**

1. "What is the basic function of a neuron in a neural network?"
2. "How does information flow through a feedforward neural network?"
3. "What role do weights play in neural network learning?"
4. "How does backpropagation adjust network weights?"
5. "Why might a neural network overfit to training data?"

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### The "Recognition vs. Recall" Trap

Many novice prompt writers create questions that test recognition rather than recall. [Recognition is significantly easier than recall]{Recognition (choosing from options) is much easier than recall (generating the answer from memory) and doesn't build the same memory strength. Always aim for free recall in your prompts to maximize learning benefits.} and doesn't build the same robust memory pathways.

**Weak (recognition)**: "Which of these is the capital of France? A) London B) Paris C) Berlin"
**Strong (recall)**: "What is the capital of France?"

### The Ambiguity Problem

Vague prompts lead to inconsistent answers and frustrated review sessions. [Every prompt should have one clear, unambiguous answer]{Precision in language is crucial for spaced repetition success. Every prompt should have one clear, unambiguous answer that you can consistently recall, reducing cognitive load and preventing confusion.}.

**Ambiguous**: "What's important about the Civil War?"
**Clear**: "What were the three main causes of the American Civil War according to historian James McPherson?"

## Advanced Techniques for Mastery

### Connection Prompts

Once you've mastered individual components, create prompts that test connections between ideas. [These "bridge" prompts help build integrative understanding]{Understanding the relationships between concepts is often more valuable than knowing isolated facts. Connection prompts help build this integrative knowledge that enables creative thinking and problem-solving.} that transfers to novel situations.

**Example connection prompts:**
- "How does the concept of market efficiency relate to the efficient market hypothesis?"
- "What's the relationship between entropy and the second law of thermodynamics?"

### Application Prompts

[Move beyond simple recall to test application]{Testing your ability to apply knowledge in novel contexts ensures you're building transferable understanding, not just rote memorization. This is where learning becomes truly valuable.} of knowledge in new contexts. These prompts help ensure your learning transfers to real-world situations.

**Application prompt example:**
"Given a patient presenting with fatigue, weight loss, and increased thirst, what diagnostic tests would you order and why?"

## Building Your Prompt-Writing Practice

### Start Small and Iterate

Begin with a limited domain and focus on mastering the fundamentals of prompt creation. [As you gain experience, you'll develop intuition]{Like any skill, prompt writing improves with deliberate practice and reflection on what works. Start simple and gradually increase complexity as your understanding of effective prompt design deepens.} for what makes prompts effective in different domains.

### Regular Review and Refinement

Your prompts aren't set in stone. As you encounter difficulties during review sessions, [refine problematic prompts]{Continuously improving your prompts based on review experience is essential for maintaining an effective spaced repetition system that serves your learning goals over time.} to make them more tractable, clear, or appropriately challenging.

## Conclusion: From Information to Understanding

Writing effective prompts for spaced repetition is both an art and a science. It requires understanding the cognitive mechanisms of memory formation while developing practical skills in knowledge decomposition and question design. [The goal is transformation]{The goal isn't just memorization—it's building a coherent understanding that enables you to think more effectively in your chosen domains, connecting ideas and applying knowledge creatively.}: converting scattered information into coherent, accessible understanding that enhances your thinking and problem-solving capabilities.

When done well, spaced repetition becomes more than a memory tool—it becomes a method for building expertise, one carefully crafted prompt at a time. The investment in learning to write good prompts pays dividends through more effective learning, better retention, and deeper understanding that transfers to real-world applications.

Remember: the quality of your prompts determines the quality of your learning. Take the time to craft them well, and they'll serve as the foundation for genuine mastery in any domain you choose to explore.
