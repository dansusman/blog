# Dan Susman's Blog

A minimal Hugo blog using the [Dario theme](https://github.com/dansusman/dario), inspired by Dario Amodei's personal website. This blog is designed to be minimal, performant, and elegant for reading.

## Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (v0.119.0 or later)
- Git

## Getting Started

### Development Server

To run the development server with live reload:

```bash
hugo server
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`. The server will automatically reload when you make changes to content or configuration.

### Building for Production

To build the static site for production:

```bash
hugo
```

This generates the static files in the `public/` directory.

### Creating New Posts

Create a new blog post:

```bash
hugo new content/posts/my-new-post.md
```

Or create the file manually in `content/posts/` with the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
author: "Dan Susman"
description: "A brief description of your post"
summary: "A summary for search engines"
date: 2024-01-01T00:00:00-00:00
draft: false
---

Your content here in markdown format.
```
